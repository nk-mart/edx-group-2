# Quote Collector

## Description

This application was created to be similar to pinterest but for the quote lovers! The aim is to build a performant and scalable front-end single-page application that will fufill this desire. The user will be able to browse a variety of wise quotes to be inspired by and store away their favourite for the perfect occasion. They will then be able to easily find and copy them, ready to post wherever they wish. We intend for it especially to be utilised for things like twitter statuses. 

We have utilised project planning and project management tools on GitHub, which enabled us to resolve merge conflicts and execute Git branching workflow collaboratively. The project provided us with an opportunity to demonstrate our problem solving skills
As a group, we will be collecting "quotes" from an API, which are saved in the user's local storage. 

## Installation
There is no need to install this app, as it is a web application fully accessible from your browser link. A contibutor may access the app with approved permision by via VS code using the command npm run start which will open up the Quote Home page in a browser

## Usage
Upon reaching the page the user will be able to click the next button to navigate through various meaningful quotes. 
They will have the option to select the 'Save' button on any of the quotes that they wish to store away for later use. 
To reach their quote collection the user will be able to navigate to their 'Collection Page' via the button on the navbar. 
Once they have reached their own personal collection page, they will have the option to scroll throught their favourite quotes, and copy to clipboard if they so wish. The user will then be able to post the quotes as they need wherever they like, for example as a twitter status.
