# Quote Collector

## Description and Objective
As a group, we are to utilised our learnt skills throughout the course to work together as a group and build a performant and scalable front-end single-page application that would fufill a real-world need. We will discuss and set out variety of issues which needed to be met in the project by utilising the project planning and project management tools on GitHub, this would enabled us to resolve merge conflicts and execute Git branching workflow collaboratively. The project will provide us with an opportunity to demonstrate our problem solving skills
As a group, we will be collecting "quotes" API data which will be saved in a local storage. We will create a code function that would allow the data to be use in developing a from-end application,
The functionality of our app will fufill the react lifecycle methods, an application navigating method which allows both "GET" and "POST" routes for retrieving and collecting data. 
## Installation

The project will utilise the use of node.js and react-app routine to help the project workflow, this will also enables the use of other technologies needed for the project.
The designed and built application will be deployed to Netlify
The Web application will be accessable via URL browser as needed.
